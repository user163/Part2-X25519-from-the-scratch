# X25519-from-the-scratch

This is not an implementation to be used in a real world scenario. It is only intended to illustrate how X25519 works.

X25519 is executed on curve 25519. Curve 25519 is a [Montgomery curve][i_1]: By^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x The curve parameters are: 

```
A = 486662 
B = 1
p = 2**255 - 19 # prime, order of Gallois field GF(p)
Gx = 9
Gy = 14781619447589544791020593568409986887264606134616475288964881837755586237401
l = 2**252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493 # order of G, = order of subgroup generated by G 
```

X25519 is described in [RFC 7748][i_2].
